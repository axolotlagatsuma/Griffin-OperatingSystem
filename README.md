# Repository : GriffinOS
## Branch : Simple Distro
This is such simple distro that uses busybox for the user space, syslinux for the bootloader and as you can predict it uses the linux kernel. 
To run it simply use:
```
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 boot
```
as we see here you'll need qemu installed on your machine. :)
