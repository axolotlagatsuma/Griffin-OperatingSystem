# **GriffinOS**
## What the heck is GriffinOS?
GriffinOS is a operating system that is planned to be based on Debian.
GriffinOS's main focus is server management, especially game server management. There is not much to say about it because it's not even in development lol.

Changelog 0.1: [CraftyController](https://craftycontrol.com) is "planned" to be come out-of-box. I didn't talked about this with Crafty Controller's developers. So that might change.
